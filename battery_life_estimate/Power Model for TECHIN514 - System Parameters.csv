REFLECTIONS : WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM ANALYZING YOUR POWER.  TALK ABOUT SOME POTENTIAL TRADEOFFS. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I determined the “days of use” metric by modeling how long the device spends in each operating mode per day and combining that with the measured and datasheet-based power consumption. By comparing the total daily energy usage with the effective battery capacity, I estimated the overall runtime in days.

Based on the results, a 500mAh LiPo battery is close to optimal for this device. It comfortably supports more than 24 hours of operation while keeping the device compact and low-cost.

To improve user experience, I could reduce WiFi transmission frequency or increase deep sleep time, trading off real-time data updates for longer battery life. Hardware changes like a more efficient regulator or lower-power radio could further improve performance, but would increase cost and design complexity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
